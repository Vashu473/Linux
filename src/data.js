            The \`ifconfig\` command in Linux is used to configure, manage, and query network interface parameters. 
            It allows you to view or configure the network interface's IP address, netmask, broadcast address, 
            and other settings. This command is typically used for troubleshooting or configuring network interfaces manually.
      
            **Example:**
      
            To view all active network interfaces and their configurations, you can use the following command:
      
            \`\`\`
            ifconfig
            \`\`\`
      
            This will display information such as IP address, subnet mask, and broadcast address for each interface.
